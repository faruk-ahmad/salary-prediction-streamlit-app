# salary-prediction-streamlit-app

Though I have been working with ML for more than 6 years, I have never been a guy who writes code for application. But it is really great to see the output of your model in a more interactive way by a web app. I have used [```streamlit```](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/api.html) for building the simple web application to visualize the salary prediction models output trained on ```stackoverflow survey 2021``` data.

This project contains the following tasks in order

1. Load ```stackoverflow``` survey data for 2021 & clean the data
2. Build a machine learning model for predicting salary of software developer based on some parameters
3. Build a simple web application using ```streamlit``` for interacting with the ml model & predict salary
4. The web app also shows the summary visualization of software developers from the survey data
